# PartOR_fused_ShapeOptimization

This repository contains the source code for the paper titled 'Part orientation fused shape optimization for minimisation of print time and material waste in extrusion-based 3D printing', Computer-Aided Design Volume Volume 192, March 2026, 104029

Instructions:

Download the GPtoolbox [https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/49692-gptoolbox] library into the 'Libraries' folder in your local repo. The current code can be run with user provided or random fixed vertex indices. If height-based regions need to be fixed, download the Exact Geodesic library [https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18168-exact-geodesic-for-triangular-meshes] into the 'Libraries' folder in your local repo.

Alternating_pipeline.m - This is the full alternating part orientation and geometry optimisation
Geometry_only_optimisation_pipeline - This is shape-only optimisation
